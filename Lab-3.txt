Lab 3: Processing of commands with pipes and fork
Relevant topics: files, pipes, fork and inter-process communication.

Specification (To be implemented and shown in lab)

Write a program that will read  a command from a user and execute them. The program should exit if the user enters a special command called "quit" or "exit". The program should use pipes to communicate between parent and child processes to implement the desired functionality.


Background Code

1. Using Unix pipes: ls, grep, cat, sort, pg, more and so on


2. Using C system calls (Source: https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Creating-a-Pipe.html)

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

/* Read characters from the pipe and echo them to stdout. */
void read_from_pipe (int file)
{
/* the variable file is of integer type and
it points a memory location that can be written 
into*/

  FILE *stream;
  int c;
  stream = fdopen (file, "r");
  while ((c = fgetc (stream)) != EOF)
    putchar (c);
  fclose (stream);
}

/* Write some random text to the pipe. */

void
write_to_pipe (int file)
{
/* the variable file is of integer type and
it points a memory location that can be written 
into*/

  FILE *stream;
  stream = fdopen (file, "w");
  fprintf (stream, "hello, world!\n");
  fprintf (stream, "goodbye, world!\n");
  fclose (stream);
}

int
main (void)
{
  pid_t pid;
  int mypipe[2];

  /* Create the pipe. */
  if (pipe (mypipe))
    {
      fprintf (stderr, "Pipe failed.\n");
      return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
  /* Create the child process. */
  pid = fork ();
  if (pid == (pid_t) 0)
    {
      /* This is the child process.
         Close other end first. */
      close (mypipe[1]);
      read_from_pipe (mypipe[0]);
      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
  else if (pid < (pid_t) 0)
    {
      /* The fork failed. */
      fprintf (stderr, "Fork failed.\n");
      return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
  else
    {
      /* This is the parent process.
         Close other end first. */
      close (mypipe[0]);
      write_to_pipe (mypipe[1]);
      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
}


Sample practice programming problem: 

1. Read from standard input of parent which is read by child and executed.
